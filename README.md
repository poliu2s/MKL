MKL

This is a repo containing programs I have written using Intel's Math Kernel Library in C++ to speed up matrix calcuations for the purpose of medical image processing.

The demo project is part of an ultrasound intervention project that I worked on in Dr. Purang Abolmaesumi's lab that is based on Abtin Rasoulian's doctorial thesis. More information can be found here: http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~purang/content/abolmaesumi/research/interventional-ultrasound.
